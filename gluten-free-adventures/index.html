At least for me, anyways. I'm not saying you have to have children to make your life complete, not even in the slightest. It is part of my life and all the fun challenges that go along with it. So I want to share my experiences as an individual and as a Mama. </p><p> This time around with my littlest one, who is eight months old, things got more fun when we figured out that he is currently sensitive to both gluten and dairy. I can sense an eyebrow or two raised up at the presumption of gluten and dairy sensitivities, I know, we were skeptical about it as well and we took our time and eliminated them both from not only his diet but mine as well. Funny enough after a few days the little one's sinuses had cleared up and his dry skin was beginning to heal. To test the reaction I had a small bit of dairy, about two small slices of cheese, and by the next feeding, he was congested again. We did the same test with gluten after the congestion had cleared up. </p><p> So it was decided, the little one and I would be going gluten and dairy free for the foreseeable future. Man, I am not going to lie, the withdrawals for dairy were intense! I've gone gluten free before in the past for personal reasons, so I knew what to expect for that part. But wow, those dairy withdrawals were crazy. I spent the better part of a week pacing the house wanting to have a glass of milk or have pasta with cheese on it. I would wake up craving dairy. It was super tough, but finally, we both got through it. </p><p>What made the transition easier for the both of us is that they now make cheese and margarine that are lactose-free. You know the worst is over when you can now go into a bakery, and my mouth doesn't water at the temptations on display. But, what I have discovered is that I still miss the baked treats and bread for a quick meal. </p><p> So, what to do? I don't want to deprive the little one of baked awesomeness, and this Mama needs her baked goods for a snack as well. I have to be honest, gluten free and dairy free premade goods and fresh baked stuff are expensive and generally not that great. To combat the bloating grocery bill I decided to continue with my experiments on gluten and dairy-free baking. Why? So my little one can enjoy homemade treats... and so that my budget doesn't break!</p><p>If you're interested in the outcome of different gluten free recipes that I develop and reviews on various products available on the grocery shelves, please follow me as we go down this path! </p><p>And before you ask, no we're not Celiac.
