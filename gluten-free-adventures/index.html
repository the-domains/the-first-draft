I can sense an eyebrow or two raised up at the presumption of gluten and dairy sensitivities, I know, we were skeptical about it as well and we took our time and eliminated them both from not only his diet but mine as well. Funny enough after a few days the little one's sinuses had cleared up and his dry skin was beginning to heal. To test the reaction I had a small bit of dairy, about two small slices of cheese, and by the next feeding, he was congested again. We did the same test with gluten after the congestion had cleared up. </p><p> So it was decided, the little one and I would be going gluten and dairy free for the foreseeable future. Man, I am not going to lie, the withdrawals for dairy were intense! I've gone gluten free before in the past for personal reasons, so I knew what to expect for that part. But wow, those dairy withdrawals were crazy. I spent the better part of a week pacing the house wanting to have a glass of milk or have pasta with cheese on it. I would wake up craving dairy. It was super tough, but finally, we both got through it. </p><p>What made the transition easier for the both of us is that they now make cheese and margarine that are lactose-free. You know the worst is over when you can now go into a bakery, and my mouth doesn't water at the temptations on display. But, what I have discovered is that I still miss the baked treats and bread for a quick meal. </p><p> So, what to do?
