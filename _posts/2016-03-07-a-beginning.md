So, you're probably wondering why I chose the name 'The First Draft.' Well, the way I see it we interact, create, react and constantly move forward in the present and only when the moment is done we get to go back and review it. 

I want to share with you some of my first draft experiences on the things that I am passionate about. What would those be, you might ask? Well, I'm a rather geeky Mama that loves to read, write, play video games, do crafts and I'm rather addicted to technology so, guaranteed there's going to be some posts about all of those!

As of this moment, I am currently working on expanding my creative writing wings. 2015 was my second year at doing NaNoWriMo, and I've caught the writing bug, so to speak. My first year I was so nervous (and boy does my first draft ever show it!) but I was so exhilarated that I finally managed to write out a story from start to finish that I wanted to try it again. This past NaNo I tried something new and way out of my comfort zone, I started posting my work to Wattpad to see whether my writing was even passable. While I don't have a large readership, I can tell when I need to go back and review a chapter and that, to me, was worth all of the anxiety and trepidation on clicking that 'publish' button.

With that in mind, I am hoping you'll follow along as continue writing and upload more of my First Draft experiences!
