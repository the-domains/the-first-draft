# Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Muffins

We all know you're here for the noms, so here is the recipe followed by a quick blurb on some tips and tricks for making these muffins.

* 2 tbsp oil
* 5 tbsp dairy free beverage
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 1/2 tbsp sugar
* 1/4 cup all-purpose gluten-free flour
* 1 1/2 tbsp sweet rice flour
* 1 1/2 tbsp gluten-free oats
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 1/8 tsp xanthan gum _\*\*Optional, this will depend if your all-purpose flour has it already\*\*_
* 1 tsp vinegar
* 1 tbsp chocolate chips

Add all ingredients except for the vinegar and the chocolate chips into a medium sized bowl and mix well. Add the chocolate chips and the vinegar, mix well. 

Divide the batter equally between four silicone muffin liners.
Place two of the liners onto a small plate and microwave for 55-58 seconds. Repeat for the uncooked muffins. Remove the muffins from the microwave and let them cool for a few minutes, they will be incredibly hot, and the melted chocolate chips are not fun on bare fingers! 

Enjoy with your favourite cup of tea, coffee or cold beverage.

## Baking Fine-tuning

Gluten-free baking is a bit challenging, things like what ingredients in your all-purpose flour, your elevation, the humidity that day, the power of your microwave, all of this stuff adds up to make baking a bit of a fine science. For example, I live in Calgary in Canada, so the elevation is quite high. Taking the elevation into consideration when I'm baking I need to add more moisture to my baking or less yeast if I'm making bread. 

I'm currently experimenting with Robin Hood's all-purpose gluten free flour which uses beets in its mix. My first experiments with this flour and recipe turned out pretty badly, the batter was thick and the cooked product ended up being crumbly. It tasted OK, but it wasn't something I'd remake. So, I started experimenting and came up with the above variation of my [muffin recipe][0].
