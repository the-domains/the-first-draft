I won't go into the nitty gritty of how the fluffy gluten free muffin quest came to be, not just yet anyways. I'm sure you're here for the recipe right now, because if you're like me, you might need a sweet baked good to make the day that little bit brighter. So here it is, after much toil and failed attempts, I present to you:

# Fluffy Gluten Free Muffins

## Chocolate Chip Style

**What you'll need**

* Four silicone muffin liners
* Plate
* Small bowl for mixing (a cereal bowl works well)
* Microwave

**Recipe**

* 1 tbsp vegetable or canola oil
* 5 tbsp milk or milk substitute
* 1 tsp vanilla extract (real or artificial, up to you!)
* 1 1/2 tbsp sugar
* 1/4 cup featherlight gluten free flour
* 1 tbsp sweet rice flour
* 2 tbsp coconut flour
* 1/8 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* dash of salt
* 1 tbsp fruit puree, such as mango or peaches
* 1 tsp vinegar
* 1 tbsp mini chocolate chips

Mix the oil, milk, vanilla and sugar together in a small bowl until combined. Add the flours, baking powder, baking soda and salt and mix until there are no lumps. Add the fruit puree and stir until combined. Finally, add the vinegar and mix well, the batter will fizz a bit because of the baking soda, so don't worry! Stir in the chocolate chips into the batter. Divide the batter into the four silicone cups.

Place two of the muffin cups onto the plate with room between the two liners and microwave for 55 seconds. 

_This is a rough time estimate because the cooking time will vary depending on things like the altitude in which you live, the type of microwave and how thick the silicone liners are._

I'm sure you're wondering why I just didn't nuke all four of them at once. I did... multiple times and they all resulted in soggy spots where they just wouldn't cook through properly. My guess would be is that there it created too much moisture with all of them baking and not enough space between the muffin liners. Two seemed to be the jackpot for my microwave, but yours might be more benevolent and let you cook 3-4 at once!

**I don't like coconut, what else can I use?**

I've had similar success using brown rice flour instead of coconut flour. The consistency was finer than with the coconut flour, but I found that it was more temperamental with the fluffiness and sometimes came out with a more gummy texture. I would discourage trying to use more sweet rice flour or featherlight flour because they are heavy flours, and they won't rise as nicely. In fact, they'll probably be the soft gummy texture I was talking about. Don't get me wrong, they're still edible, just not what I was hoping for regarding fluffiness.

Enjoy!
