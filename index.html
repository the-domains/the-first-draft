This past NaNo I tried something new and way out of my comfort zone, I started posting my work to Wattpad to see whether my writing was even passable. While I don't have a large readership, I can tell when I need to go back and review a chapter and that, to me, was worth all of the anxiety and trepidation on clicking that 'publish' button.</p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="73"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="74"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="75"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="76"><span data-reactid="77"><!-- react-empty: 78 --><h2 data-reactid="79"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="80">The First Draft</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="81"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="82"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="83"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
